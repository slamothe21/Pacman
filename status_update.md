We have not had problems with coding, just figuring out the functions needed to make the game operate the way we want to.



###F. What do you plan to do in the week remaining before Dean's Date for an expected version of your project?
We will get the code to display the game of PacMan and have the function work to move Pacman.

We will be able to have the ghost move randomly while changing color. The game will keep score as well.

way for your project preceptor to provide additional feedback.*
